<h1 align="center">Welcome to my WeLoveMoviesBackendProject</h1>

This is one of my capstone projects. It is a backend server for a movie review project. This server completes all CRUD requests for the project. The API is set up using RESTful constraints. 

Backend live <a href="https://welovemovies-angel.herokuapp.com/movies" >here</a>
This will lead you to the movies in the database. You can replace 'movies' with 'theaters' to see the theaters in the database.

Frontend component attachment and demo coming soon.
